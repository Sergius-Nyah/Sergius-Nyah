# Hi :)

Firstly ~> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs
## Who I am; 
I'm a curiosity-bound individual with a keen interest in deep learning, AI on the web, algorithms, and their interactions in our soceity. I believe that these fields have the potential to shape the future and solve our most pressing problems.

## What I'm Working On

- 🤖 **Algorithms**: I'm fascinated by algorithms, from classic sorting and searching algorithms to modern graph algorithms and machine learning algorithms. I believe that understanding algorithms is essential for solving complex problems.
- (Sometime soon) 🧠 **Deep Learning**: I'm currently working on developing deep learning models for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. I'm particularly interested in generative models and their applications.
